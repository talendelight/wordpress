**Priority:** High  
**Phase:** MVP  
**Target Version:** v3.1.0

Public landing page for **Scouts** (talent referrers who submit candidate CVs on behalf of others). Scouts can be employees or external contractors who find candidates and earn commission/rewards for successful placements.

**URL:** `/scouts/`  
**Audience:** External talent scouts, recruiters, employees doing referrals  
**Access:** Public (no login required to view page)

## Business Context

### What is a Scout?

**Definition:** A Scout is either an employee or contractor who:
- Finds and refers tech talent candidates
- Submits multiple CVs of other people (with their consent)
- Earns commission or rewards for successful placements
- Acts as talent sourcer/referrer (not a recruiter)

**Scout Types:**
1. **External Contractors:** Freelance talent sourcers, independent recruiters
2. **Internal Employees:** TalenDelight staff doing candidate sourcing
3. **Network Referrers:** Industry professionals referring candidates from their network

**Key Differences from Other Roles:**
- **Candidate:** Submits own CV
- **Scout:** Submits other people's CVs (requires consent)
- **Employer:** Requests candidates for open positions
- **Operator:** Internal team member managing pipeline
