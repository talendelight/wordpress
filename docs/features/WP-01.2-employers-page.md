| Content too generic | Medium | Medium | Use specific technical terminology, concrete timelines, real process details. |
| CTA buttons have no destination | Low | High | Link to Contact page for MVP, add dedicated form in iteration. |
| Mobile layout too cramped | Low | Medium | Test responsive design thoroughly, adjust grid layouts as needed. |
