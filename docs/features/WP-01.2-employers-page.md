| Content too generic | Medium | Medium | Use specific technical terminology, concrete timelines, real process details. |
| CTA buttons have no destination | Low | High | Link to Contact page for MVP, add dedicated form in iteration. |
| Mobile layout too cramped | Low | Medium | Test responsive design thoroughly, adjust grid layouts as needed. |

## Form Submission Design (Updated Jan 4, 2026)

### Simplified Consultative Flow

**Philosophy:** Low-friction initial contact → Operator-guided detailed discovery

### Initial Request Form (Single Page - Simple)

**Page:** `/request-candidates/` or embedded on `/employers/` page

**Required Fields:**
1. Contact name (text input)
2. Contact email (email input, validated)
3. Contact phone (text input)
4. Company name (text input)
5. Location - Country (dropdown with search)
6. Location - City (text input)
7. **Meeting slots (3 required):**
   - Slot 1: Date picker + Time picker
   - Slot 2: Date picker + Time picker
   - Slot 3: Date picker + Time picker

**Optional Fields:**
8. Upload requirements document (PDF/DOC/DOCX, max 5MB)
9. Textarea: "I already have documented requirements" (<500 chars)

**Submit Button:** "Start Discussion"

**Help Text:** "Share 3 time slots that work for you. We'll pick one and send a calendar invite."

### Post-Submission Flow

**1. User submits form**
- Form data + attachments saved as JSON to: `/tmp/inputs/employer-requests/{user.id}/YYYY-MM/{timestamp}.json`
- Email notification sent to operations team
- User sees success message: "Thank you! We'll review your request and contact you within 1 business day to schedule a discussion."

**2. Operator reviews submission**
- Opens admin panel/email notification
- Reviews contact info, location, meeting slots, optional requirements
- **Decision point:**
  - ✅ **Sufficient info:** Schedule meeting using one of the provided slots → Send calendar invite
  - ❌ **Need more details:** Generate dynamic form link → Email to user

**3. Dynamic form link generation (if needed)**
- Operator clicks: "Request More Details" button in admin
- System generates:
  - Unique token: `{request-id}-{random-hash}`
  - URL: `/request-details/{token}/`
  - Expiry: 5 days from generation
- Operator can customize what fields to show:
  - Pre-fill already provided info (read-only or hidden)
  - Show only missing/unclear fields
  - Add operator notes/questions
- Email sent to user:
  - Subject: "TalenDelight - Additional details needed for your hiring request"
  - Body: Personalized message + link to dynamic form
  - Expiry warning: "This link expires in 5 days"

**4. User completes detailed form (if link sent)**
- User clicks link → Lands on `/request-details/{token}/`
- Pre-filled info shown (read-only or hidden)
- Additional fields shown:
  - Role title
  - Seniority/level
  - Engagement type
  - Work mode
  - Must-have skills
  - Nice-to-have skills
  - Role summary
  - Number of hires
  - Start timeframe
- User submits → Data appended to original JSON
- Operator notified of completion

### Technical Implementation

**Form Plugin:** WPForms Lite + custom hooks

**JSON Structure (Initial Submission):**
```json
{
  "request_id": "req-20260104-1234",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-04T10:30:00Z",
  "user_id": null,
  "status": "initial",
  "contact": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@company.com",
    "phone": "+371 12345678",
    "company": "TechCorp",
    "location": {
      "country": "Latvia",
      "city": "Riga"
    }
  },
  "meeting_slots": [
    {"date": "2026-01-10", "time": "14:00"},
    {"date": "2026-01-11", "time": "10:00"},
    {"date": "2026-01-12", "time": "15:00"}
  ],
  "requirements": {
    "file_path": "/tmp/inputs/employer-requests/guest/2026-01/req-20260104-1234-jd.pdf",
    "text": "Need 2 senior Java developers for microservices project..."
  },
  "dynamic_form_token": null,
  "dynamic_form_expiry": null
}
```

**Dynamic Form Features:**
- Token validation (check expiry)
- Pre-fill logic (pull data from original JSON)

## Open Questions

1. **Meeting slot timezone handling:** Store time in user's local timezone or UTC?
   - **Recommendation:** Store as entered + capture user's timezone from browser (auto-detect)

2. **Dynamic link admin UI:** Build custom WordPress admin page or use external tool?
   - **Recommendation:** Custom WordPress admin page for v3.0.0, manual email for MVP

3. **Calendar integration:** Manual scheduling or integrate with Google Calendar/Calendly?
   - **Recommendation:** Manual for MVP, integration in future

4. **Guest submissions:** Allow non-logged-in users (MVP) or require account?
   - **Decision:** Allow guest submissions (user_id = null or "guest")

5. **Skills input drag-and-drop:** Still needed for detailed form?
   - **Status:** Future enhancement (OA-001)
