## MVP Scope vs Post-MVP

### MVP Scope (v3.6.0 - April 2026)

**Included in MVP:**
- ✅ Page layout and navigation structure (Phase 1 - Complete)
- 📋 Access control (Managers and Admins only)
- 📋 Basic Team Performance Overview section (manual/placeholder data)
- 📋 Navigation tiles to management pages
- 📋 All Operator capabilities (candidates, employers, scouts management)
- 📋 Operator oversight (view all Operator activities, reassign work)
- 📋 Scout oversight (view all Scout submissions across Operators)
- 📋 Basic CSV export functionality
- 📋 User approval workflow (registration requests, verification, approval/rejection)

**Not Included in MVP:**
- ❌ Dynamic Team Performance dashboard with live metrics
- ❌ Performance alerts and capacity visualization
- ❌ Finance management page
- ❌ Performance management page (rankings, ratings)
- ❌ Admin/system configuration page
- ❌ Advanced reports and analytics page
- ❌ Bulk operations (status updates, reassignments)
- ❌ Global analytics dashboards
- ❌ Automated workflows and notifications

### Post-MVP Features (v3.7.0+)

**Finance Administration (Post-MVP - Manager-Only):**
- Commission calculation and payment processing
- Scout rate management and payment tracking
- Operator compensation management (NEVER visible to Operators)
- Employer billing and invoicing
- Financial reports and cash flow forecasting
- **Rationale:** Finance functionality requires accounting integration and complex business logic; deferred until operational workflows validated

**Performance Management (Post-MVP - Manager-Only):**
- Scout rankings and performance scores
- Operator rankings and performance metrics
- Employer value rankings
- Quality scores and placement rates
- Performance-based commission adjustments
- Feedback and review system
- **Rationale:** Requires baseline operational data collection before meaningful metrics can be calculated

**Bulk Operations (Post-MVP):**
- Bulk candidate reassignments
- Bulk status updates
- Bulk email communications
- Batch export operations
- **Rationale:** MVP focuses on manual one-by-one processing to validate workflows

**Global Analytics Dashboards (Post-MVP):**
- Real-time performance visualizations
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Predictive analytics
- Custom dashboard builder
- Automated report scheduling
- **Rationale:** Requires operational data history and analytics infrastructure

**System Administration (Post-MVP):**
- Platform configuration management
- User role and permission management
- System settings and integrations
- Audit log review interface
- **Rationale:** Basic RBAC sufficient for MVP; advanced admin features deferred

**Automated Workflows (Post-MVP):**
- Auto-assignment based on workload/capacity
- Auto-status progression rules
- Smart notification triggers
- Escalation workflows
- **Rationale:** Manual workflows must be validated before automation

**Advanced Team Oversight (Post-MVP):**
- Capacity planning and forecasting
- Workload balancing recommendations
- Performance coaching insights
- Team collaboration features
- **Rationale:** Requires multi-Operator environment and historical data

**MVP Focus:** Core operational workflows (view, search, assign, update, approve registrations) to support solo Manager initially, with ability to onboard Operators. Advanced management features deferred to allow validation of basic workflows and accumulation of operational data.

## 7. Performance Management Page - POST-MVP

## 8. Finance Management Page - POST-MVP

**Status:** 🔮 Post-MVP (v3.7.0+) - Not included in MVP scope

**Rationale:** Finance administration requires:
- Accounting system integration (e.g., Xero, QuickBooks)
- Payment gateway integration
- Commission calculation algorithms
- Invoice generation system
- Legal/tax compliance framework
- Financial audit trail requirements
- Operator compensation policies (NEVER visible to Operators)

MVP focuses on operational workflows. Financial management will be developed with proper accounting integration and business logic validation.

## 14. Implementation Notes

### 14.1 WordPress Capabilities

**Create Manager-specific capability:** `manage_finance`

**Assign to Manager role:**
- All Operator capabilities
- `manage_finance`
- `view_all_candidates`
- `view_all_employers`
- `manage_operators`
- `view_performance`
- `reassign_any`
- `override_status`

### 14.2 Finance Page Security Implementation

```php
// At top of finance page template
if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_finance' ) ) {
    wp_die( 
        __( 'Access denied. Finance page is only accessible to Managers.', 'talendelight' ),
        __( 'Access Denied', 'talendelight' ),
        array( 'response' => 403 )
    );
}

// Log access
td_log_audit_event( array(
    'action' => 'finance_page_access',
    'user_id' => get_current_user_id(),
    'ip_address' => $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'],
    'timestamp' => current_time( 'mysql' ),
) );
```

### 14.3 Data Queries

**Manager queries must exclude Operator-only restrictions:**

```php
// Operator query (restricted)
$candidates = get_posts( array(
    'post_type' => 'td_candidate',
    'meta_query' => array(
        array(
            'key' => '_assigned_operator',
            'value' => get_current_user_id(),
        ),
    ),
) );

// Manager query (unrestricted)
$candidates = get_posts( array(
    'post_type' => 'td_candidate',
    // No assignment restriction
) );
```

### 14.4 Performance Optimization

**Cache expensive calculations:**
- Team metrics (cache for 5 minutes)
- Performance rankings (cache for 1 hour)
- Financial summaries (cache for 15 minutes)
- Use WordPress Transients API

---

## 15. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Mobile app for managers
- Email/SMS alerts for critical items
- Integration with accounting software
- Custom dashboard builder

- [ ] What triggers "overloaded" Operator alerts (90% or configurable)?
- [ ] Should performance grades be automated or manually reviewed?
- [ ] What's the approval process for commission rate changes?
- [ ] Should Managers receive daily/weekly summary emails?
- [ ] How are performance grades calculated (specific formula)?
- [ ] What's the retention period for audit logs?
- [ ] Should financial data be exportable for external accounting?
