## 🔄 Deferred to Next Release

### 1. Header Menu Configuration
**Issue:** Menu exists in admin but not assigned to display location  
**Reason:** Theme location assignment unclear, needed more exploration time  
**Impact:** Menu not visible on website header  
**Next Steps:** Configure menu display location in v3.0.0

### 2. WP User Manager Detailed Settings
**Reason:** Settings interface complex, deferred to avoid errors  
**Current State:** Plugin installed with default settings  
**Next Steps:** Configure email verification, registration flow, redirect behavior in v3.0.0

### 3. Login Redirect Configuration
**Decision:** Defer until role-based smart routing implementation  
**Current Behavior:** All users redirect to `/account/` after login  
**Future Enhancement:** Role-based redirect (Employer→/employers/, Candidate→/candidates/, etc.)  
**Timeline:** v3.0.0 with Employers page (WP-01.2)

### 4. Help Page Deployment
**Status:** Exists in local dev, not deployed to production  
**Reason:** Focus on core authentication functionality first  
**Next Steps:** Deploy Help page in v3.0.0

### 5. Additional Test Users
**Created in production:** employer_test, candidate_test (2 of 4)  
**Not created:** scout_test, operator_test  
**Next Steps:** Create remaining test users when testing Scout/Operator features

### 6. Page Sync
**Not synced to local:**
- Privacy Policy page (exists in production only)

**Not synced to production:**
- About us page
- Help page

**Decision:** Sync pages properly when building WP-01.5 (Privacy Policy) and deploying Help page

## 🐛 Known Issues

### 1. Header Menu Not Visible
**Symptom:** Menu created in admin but doesn't appear in website header  
**Cause:** Menu location not assigned to theme display location  
**Workaround:** None - will fix in next release  
**Resolution:** Assign menu to correct Blocksy theme location

### 2. Logout Redirects to WordPress Default
**Symptom:** Logout link goes to `wp-login.php` instead of `/log-in/`  
**Cause:** Login/Logout Menu plugin default redirect behavior  
**Impact:** Minor UX inconsistency  
**Resolution:** Configure plugin redirect settings (deferred)

### 3. No Role-Based Redirect After Login
**Symptom:** All users land on `/account/` regardless of role  
**Expected Behavior:** Employers→/employers/, Candidates→/candidates/, etc.  
**Status:** By design - smart routing deferred to Phase 2  
**Resolution:** Implement custom role-based redirect logic in v3.0.0

## ⏱️ Actual Time Breakdown

| Task | Estimated | Actual | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Git merge and push | 5 min | 5 min | ✅ On schedule |
| Remove WooCommerce | 3 min | 5 min | ⚠️ Slightly over |
| Install plugins | 5 min | 10 min | ⚠️ Manual upload needed |
| Delete pages | 3 min | 5 min | ✅ Acceptable |
| Page sync discussion | 1 min | 10 min | ⚠️ Clarification needed |
| Configure menu | 7 min | Deferred | ⚠️ Skipped |
| Configure WPUM | 5 min | Deferred | ⚠️ Skipped |
| Update "Get Started" button | 5-10 min | 15 min | ⚠️ Template troubleshooting |
| Create test users | - | 10 min | ℹ️ Not originally planned |
| Testing | 10 min | 15 min | ✅ Thorough testing |
| **Total** | **46-51 min** | **~120 min** | ⚠️ 2.4x over estimate |

**Variance Analysis:**
- Menu configuration took longer than expected due to theme location confusion
- Page sync required discussion to clarify strategy
- Test user creation added to scope during deployment
- Elementor template import required delete-then-insert approach (not documented)

---

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### Security Posture
- ✅ WooCommerce removed (reduces attack surface)
- ✅ WP User Manager handles authentication (trusted plugin)
- ⚠️ Test users use weak passwords (`Test123!`) - acceptable for testing
- ⚠️ Test users should be deleted before public launch

### Compliance Notes
- ⚠️ Privacy Policy page exists but content needs review for GDPR compliance
- ℹ️ WP User Manager supports email verification (not yet configured)

---

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Elementor template export/import** - efficient way to deploy button changes
2. **WP User Manager auto-page creation** - saved manual work
3. **Test user creation** - caught login flow issues early
4. **Git auto-deploy** - Hostinger integration worked smoothly

### What Could Improve
1. **Menu configuration** - need better theme location documentation
2. **Time estimation** - underestimated complexity of menu/plugin config
3. **Page sync strategy** - needed upfront clarification
4. **Plugin availability** - Login/Logout Menu not in Hostinger marketplace (manual upload workaround)

### Process Improvements
1. **Pre-deployment:** Test menu location assignment on staging first
2. **Documentation:** Add screenshots for theme-specific menu configuration
3. **Scope management:** Better at deferring non-critical items upfront
4. **Plugin research:** Check Hostinger marketplace availability before planning
